                        <p>But hire a former enemy and he will be more loyal than a friend, because he has more to

                            At the very beginning of achieving anything, you have to determine what you are going after
                            but
                            most
                            importantly why. Your actions will be determined in direct proportion to what level of
                            desire
                            you
                            have
                            to achieve your goals and dreams. Your desire is directly affected by the reason that you
                            are
                            going
                            after something.

                            So before you draw the map of achievement, you must really dig deep into your emotions and
                            determine
                            what would set the gasoline on your fire. You should put a lot of time and effort into this
                            and
                            decide
                            that there are no other options than fulfilling these goals and dreams.

                            One oft-told tale about Kissinger… involved a report that Winston Lord had worked on for
                            days.
                            After

                            7. If It’s Scarce, People Want More
                        </i>
                        <p>
                            The scarcity principle underpins the second law of power. When resources or opportunities
                            are
                            scarce,
                            people tend to want them more. This principle not only influences decision-making but also
                            drives
                            competition.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Companies often use the scarcity principle in product releases, limited-time offers, and
                            exclusive
                            events. Creating a sense of urgency or exclusivity stimulates demand and generates buzz
                            around
                            their
                            offerings. To create scarcity in your endeavors, consider limiting the availability of your
                            products
                            or services or creating a sense of urgency through deadlines or countdowns.

                        </i>
                        <p>
                            It’s a psychological power to calculate the value of everything in your life to determine if
                            they
                            are
                            worth your time, energy, and money. This goes for services, food, employees, products, and
                            even
                            if
                            your
                            job is worth <br>

                            This applies to whether you get the value for your cost of living where you live and value
                            for
                            your
                            tax
                            expenses to your local and national government. Calculating value allows you to make
                            rational
                            and
                            intelligent investments of your time, energy, and money. This can be a huge psychological
                            edge
                            over
                            those that put no thought into cost versus value in all areas of their life. <br><br>
